## Intro
Hello and thank you for visiting my introduction page!
Here you can find out a little bit about who I am and what my coding looks like.
Please feel free to contact me with any comments or questions.

## Short Biography
My interests in IT started when I was in high school in the late 90's. I enrolled
in computer programming and electronics courses, earning an award of merit in 
computer studies upon graduating.  I also chose Computer Science for my major in 
college and took courses in Programming, Solaris, Networking and more.  
While in college I worked as technical product support for a small company that
eventually lead into a Jr. System Administration role. My passion for learning
and developing my skillset soon lead to a Sr. System Administration role and leading
the operations team. 
I later moved into an IT consultant position and setup a small IT team to provide
all kinds of techinical support for local businesses.  We'd provide everything from
phone support, to full office network deployments, to website programming. One of 
my favorite solutions was implementing Japanese language character support into the
office issued Windows Mobile phones back in 2006, when there was no official option
and we hacked the language files on the phones themselves. 
I then relocated to the bay area and took a full time position as Sr. System Admin
for Curse.  I loved working there and provided full support for their office. This 
included researching and learning new solutions like 8x8 VOIP, Salesforce, Sharepoint,
Oracle fusion and more. When they relocated to Irvine, I then moved to HPE.  I've since
been working at HPE and Microfocus providing Sr. System Administrator, Automation, 
Site Reliability and DevOps skills.  Today, I'm focusing on DevOps style IT solutions
that implement CI/CD, Automation, Infrastruture as Code and Cloud Solutions.

## Coding for fun!
One of my favorite hobbies is to create scripts / bots for mobile games.  Usually
it starts as a few lines of code to automate a simple task and then grows into 
a massive game automation script.  Usually I use an Android emulator like Droid4x
and AutoIT scripting language to analyze the game window and make decisions on which 
actions to take. You can see some examples of my scripts in the AutoIT folder.

## Terraform
My current favorite thing is writing infrastructure as code(IaC).  IaC has some
fantastic benefits when it comes to documenting your operations, recording
changes and versioning, and rapid deployment of additional environments. 
I've decided to showcase a few modules I've put together with help from reviewing
code at registery.terraform.io

## Ansible
In the past, I'd create bash scripts that would deploy changes via SSH and
manually adjust any erroneous results.  After finding ansible, it's become
a thousand times easier in addition to easily reproducable and documented.

## bash
Previous to using Ansible, bash and cron were my best friends when working
on linux systems.  I've included some scripts that I used to orchestrate
docker systems and build docker hosts.

## PowerShell
For years now I've relied on powershell to help administrate my Microsoft
based systems.  I've compiled a script called Custom-Functions.ps1 which
contains a lot of useful functions I include in most my scripts.  The other
scripts included showcase some of the more interesting solutions I've put
together recently, including launching AWS instances in background jobs.

## PowerCLI
I've built out PowerCLI based scripts to do a few important tasks. Namely,
automatically configuring and deploying new ESX hosts.  This ensures all
the important configuration settings are consistant across hosts in a cluster.
Also included is a script that automates VM decommissioning and replacement
with a new template, and launches as a background job to allow multiple
replacements concurrently.

## PHP
I've included some PHP scripts I created to poll web API's and store 
metrics based on the results.  These scripts were called via cron job
using the bash script also included.

## Javascript
I've done a number of javascript based projects including a web redesign
using Node.js and React / Redux, a chrome plugin to assist with making
reservations on recreation.gov, and building websites for various friends
or charities like my local boy scout troop.


## Closing Thoughts
I've put this repo together to help you get an understanding of my programming
capabilities.  I'll admit here that google & stackexchange are my second
brain when writing code.  But I hope that I've conveyed my sense of drive
to finding solutions to problems, helping out my teams, and buiding
new solutions using the best technologies available.
